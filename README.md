# VBA Demonstrations Repository

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive set of VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) demonstration scripts covering various programming concepts and techniques. The demos are designed to help learners understand VBA programming by showcasing both non-efficient and efficient coding approaches.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following topical folders:

1. `01_basic_subroutines_functions`: Introduction to VBA subroutines and functions
2. `02_debugging`: Techniques and strategies for debugging VBA code
3. `03_errhandling`: Error handling and management in VBA
4. `04_user_forms`: Creating and working with user interface forms
5. `05_loops`: Demonstrating different types of loops in VBA
6. `06_arrays`: Array manipulation and advanced array techniques
7. `07_external_source_import`: Importing data from external sources
8. `08_file_system_object`: Working with files and system objects
9. `09_oop`: Object-Oriented Programming principles in VBA
10. `10_report_and_charts`: Creating reports and data visualizations
11. `11_performance`: Performance optimization techniques

## Learning Approach

### Efficient vs Non-Efficient Coding
In each demonstration, you can compare two versions of code:
- **Non-Efficient Coding**: Earlier, more basic implementations.
- **Efficient Coding**: Optimized final versions showing best practices

### How to View Code Versions

#### Option 1: Direct File Comparison
1. Navigate to the specific topic folder
2. Look for multiple versions of scripts (e.g., `script_v1.vba`, `script_v2.vba`)
3. Compare the files to understand the evolution of the code

#### Option 2: Git History
1. Use GitHub's built-in file history feature
2. Click on any script file
3. Select "History" button to view previous commits and versions

Steps to view the previous versions:
- Go to the code and look for `History` on the upper right side to find previous commits.

- The order of versions are descending, so the previous code we ran are found in the lower commits.
  - Click the commit you want to see (older versions or newer versions)
